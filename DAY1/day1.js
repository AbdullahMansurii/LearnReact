/**
React is a SPA- single page applicaton
everything is on indexedDB.html file
react makes its own virtual DOM also
u can render html tags through javascript, it is called jsx
//* jsx returns only 1 element , therefore people often used div tag to wrap several elements
//* to solve this, react introduced fragments '<> </>'
**react is a library, not a framework
**library is used to implement a feature, framework is used to create a whole application
